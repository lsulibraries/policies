# Site and collection administration

## Permissions and users

The LDL allows for anonymous users (the public) and authenticated users. Authenticated users have a username and password. 

User accounts are tied to roles. Roles in the LDL consist of:

* Administrator
* Collection administrator
* Intern
* Repository administrator (not used)
* Site administrator (not used)
* Xquery

*check with Dave and Jason about the differences here. It's not apparent all the existing roles are intended to be used.*
