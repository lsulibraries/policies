## Accessing reports

To get page visits to your institution, particular collections, or specific items, go to *Behavior >> Site Content >> All Pages*.

At the top right is the time frame for the stats. You can adjust it to what interests you, such as the last month.

Above the table is a search box where you can filter.  

To get stats for your institution, enter your institution code, (ex. *lsm*, *hnoc*, *lsuhscs*). The top number in the Pageviews column is the total. For those institutions with lsu in the institution code, things get trickier because your code might be included inside others’ codes (*lsu*, *lsuhsc*).  To gather all collections, objects and your landing page all in one query, enter your institution code, followed by a dash, pipe symbol, then institution code followed by dollar sign $. So for lsuhsc, the query would be *lsuhsc-|lsuhsc$* 

To get stats for a collection, enter the namespace, which includes the institution code and the collection code (ex. *loyno-p16313coll28*, *hnoc-aww*).

To get stats for an item, enter the PID, including the namespace and the number after the colon (ex. *state-lhp:8786*)

A collection landing page will have a URL that ends with “:collection” (ex. *http://louisianadigitallibrary.org/islandora/object/hnoc-clf:collection*).

An institutional landing page will have a URL that ends with the institution code (exc *http://louisianadigitallibrary.org/hnoc*).

To see a list of top collections, search for *:collection$*.

To export the information to a spreadsheet, at the top right is a button for Export, in PDF, Google Sheet, Excel or CSV format.
