# Project intake form
 
## Title of project

## Request date

## Sponsor *Usually the accountable person*                Contact info

## Other stakeholders *Library staff members, Administration, Other institutions, Vendors, Primary audience, if group then main contact or representative*

## Budget

## Timeline
*Milestones, Deadlines*

## Primary Objectives and Description of project

## Project characteristics
* internal vs external  
* simple vs complex 
* novelty (Mark 1 vs Mark n) *Mark 1 = first time doing this type of project, Mark n = type of project has been done before*
* greenfield vs brownfield *greenfield is new work, brownfield is work on legacy system*

## Special considerations
* Metadata work
* Branding/Theming/Graphic Design
* Automation
* Content
	* Is it new content?
    * Does content need to be created, reformatted, revised
    * Will it be refreshed or updated after launch
    * Archiving/backups
    * Ownership
* Technology
    * Platforms/applications
        * Servers
        * Databases
        * Licenses
        * Hosting
        * Software customization
        * Integrations with existing software
    * URL/domain (current or proposed)

## Priorities/Constraints
* Budget vs scope vs timing *(If possible, rank them)*
* Is this project blocking/impeding other work?
* Cost of delay profile:
    * Linear (Cost of delay increases at stead rate)
    * Large fixed cost (One-time cost)
    * Must do now (Immediate and aggressive cots of delay)
    * Fixed date (Zero cost until deadline)
    * Logarithmic (Majority of delay cost is early, less later)
    * Intagible (Low cost early, suddenly much more at some undetermined later date)
    
## Obstacles

## Status reporting
* Frequency
* Communication preferences
    * Big group/small group
    * Tool *(Trello, JIRA, Slack, Email, Meetings/Web conferences, GitHub projects, Shared drive)*
* Release announcement
* Attach links to supporting documentation here (Trello/JIRA cards, folder path, GitHub repo)

## Maintenance and support
* Lifecycle of site/app *(When or how could it be shut down?)* 
* Closing the project
	* Documentation
	* Where will project documentation be kept
	* Who writes it?

## Last updated *when the form was last updated*
