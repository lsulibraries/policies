When a collection is newly-created, it wil be published or unpublished, depending on site-level defaults.

When you are ready to publish an unpublished collection, navigate to /islandora/object/<namespace>:collection/manage/properties and ensure that the 'Publish' checkbox is checked.

To unpublish a published collection, navigate as before and ensure that the 'Publish' checkbox is unchecked. If the collection is also available from the main LDL site, navigate there to ensure that it was also unpublished.
