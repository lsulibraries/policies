The LDL is governed by the Louisiana Digital Consortium. The LDL Steering Committee serves as an advisor to provide feedback and set priorities for the LDL Development Team.

# Louisiana Digital Consortium
The Louisiana Digital Consortium (LDC) is a partnership of participating Louisiana libraries, museums, archives and cultural heritage institutions. The purpose of the LDC is to be the Louisiana entity under which a variety of digital initiatives and services and cooperative programs are developed and or sponsored. The LDC provides governance and leadership to ensure the effective operation, orderly growth and fiscal sustainability of the Louisiana Digital Library and other cooperative programs.

There are currently 22 participating libraries, archives, museums, and historical centers participating in the LDL. Each institution contributes the digital items and the descriptive text for their collections. You will find that some of the collections, such as the Teaching History in Louisiana Project, are collaborative projects that include materials from many institutions.

## Migration
Much of the development work of 2016 and early 2017 was to migrate 186 digital collections from the CONTENTdm platform to the new Islandora platform. The LDL Development Team migrated over 100,000 (update with final count after migration is complete) digital objects and transformed the accompanying metadata from Dublin Core to MODS.

The Extract/Transform/Load (ETL) process was facilitated by using code repositories such as [MIK, the Move to Islandora Kit](https://github.com/MarcusBarnes/mik) (developed by Marcus Barnes, Simon Fraser University), and scripts developed locally: [cDMtoMODS](https://github.com/lsulibraries/cDM_to_mods) and [cdm_exporter](https://github.com/lsulibraries/cdm_xporter). Batch imports into Islandora were facilitated by using drush scripts.
