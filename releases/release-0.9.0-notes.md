# 0.9.0
Pushed to production on 7 April 2018

## release notes
This release introduced a significant set of changes to the production system;
not surprising that there were issues. Main lessons learnt:
- ensure everyone involved can be on hand for the push
- increase congruence between systems to avoid unforseen issues in prod
- refine release team procedure and roles
  - devs required
  - communication
  - what to do when things go wrong
    - and how to communicate that internally and externally
- introduce even basic automated testing
  - this would have uncovered the issue where 'replace' and 'versions' for datastreams was hidden by theme work

### Problems
- replace datastream unavailable in theme
- discrepancies in features?
- establish release team and their availability when planning release
- get content into dev/test
  - institution descriptions/titles
  - users
  - ip embargo
  - unpublished collections
