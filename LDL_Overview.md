# LDL Overview

## What is the Louisiana Digital Library (LDL)?

The Louisiana Digital Library (LDL) is an online library containing photographs, maps, manuscript materials, books, oral histories, and more that document history and culture. Libraries, museums, archives, historical groups, and other institutions across the State contribute materials to the LDL.

There are 17 participating institutions in the LDL. Each institution contributes the digital items and the descriptive text for their collections. Some collections, such as the Teaching History in Louisiana Project (TAHIL), are collaborative projects that include materials from many institutions.

### Migration 

Much of the development work of 2016-2017 was to migrate 186 digital collections from the CONTENTdm platform to the new Islandora platform. The LDL Development Team migrated over 100,000 *(update with final count after migration is complete)* digital objects and transformed the accompanying metadata from Dublin Core to MODS.

The Extract/Transform/Load (ETL) process was facilitated by using code repositories such as [MIK, the Move to Islandora Kit](https://github.com/MarcusBarnes/mik) (developed by Marcus Barnes, Simon Fraser University), and scripts developed locally: [cDM_to_MODS](https://github.com/lsulibraries/cDM_to_mods) and [cdm_exporter](https://github.com/lsulibraries/cdm_xporter). Batch imports into Islandora were facilitated by using drush scripts.
