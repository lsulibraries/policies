# Product delivery

## Goal

Handover of LDL from dev team to ops team, moving into a maintenance/feature-building stage.

- We are no longer 'building the LDL' (project with unlimited scope)
- work continues, but projects are scoped/contained
- policies are well-defined, written, and available
- service level is well-defined, available, and its terms are agreed by stakeholders

## context

Recent deadlines, soft/hard, currently in a grey area where our current position, way forward are not well known/defined...

### constituencies

#### LDC Board

#### System account holders (CAs, Interns, ...)

#### LSU Libraries Administration

#### Tech Initiatives / Digital Programs & Services

#### Islandora community

#### LSU Libraries

#### Faculty (LSU and others)

#### end users


### definitions of done

What are the measures of completion/success ? How do constituencies argee that the product has been delivered ?

NB we prefer the term _delivered_ rather than _completed_ or _done_ in order to emphasize the new phase of the project..

### Features

These are the essential things to deliver:

- expanded user roles (cataloger, intern, publisher, find & replace)
- remote content harvesting and syncing
- book and newspaper workflows established and tested
- disaster recovery protocol (procedures and service level commitments)
- public documentation
- solr indexing is settled (currently not clear when/if batch items are indexed)
- unified theme (all content types and landing pages are styled, for example)
- blog/communication channel

## Policies

- support: ticketing, issue reporting, feature requesting
- system admin permissions in production (define appropriate admin roles)
- development of features (policy describing how features are developed and integrated into the production system)
- remote harvesting and syncing
- local LSU (as a contributing institution) content management processes
- communication channels policies (overlaps with feature-dev, support), including how the two tech groups communicate, how LDC communication happens, etc...
- user training protocol and materials
